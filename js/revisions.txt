List of Revisions Based on Feedback Received:

-Changed "getRandomSpeed()" function to a method of the Enemy object.

-Added colons at the end of functions that were previously missing them.

-Created Player.prototype.reset() function to move the player back to start so the enemy class does not manually reset the
player's coordinates.

-Removed the variable collisionChecker to simplify collision detection using an if statement in the Enemy.update method

-Created a variable to refer to the "scoreboard" div rather than use the "document.getElementById("scoreboard");" line
of code each time I was looking to update the score
